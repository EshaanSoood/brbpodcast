## A. Summary

- Mobile nav lacked a toggle and crowded at small widths; added accessible details/summary toggle and capped logo.
- Content images were globally hidden; restored visibility with safe defaults.
- Decorative hero stripes could intercept taps; set pointer-events: none and ensured high z-index for nav toggle.
- Card angles and overlaps risked clipping on small screens; softened angles and removed overlaps under 768px.
- Tap targets were under 44px in places; increased button padding to meet min size.
- Potential missing CSS variable definitions; added root fallbacks to avoid layout breaks.
- Prevented horizontal scroll caused by transforms/decorative layers on lists.

## B. Breakpoint Checklists

### 320 / 360 / 390 / 414
- Header/nav: toggle visible and keyboard-operable; nav sits above decor.
- Logo: capped via class; intrinsic size preserved.
- Scroll: no horizontal scroll.
- Tap targets: ≥ 44px.
- Content: images visible where expected.
- Overlaps/skew: no clipping; subtle effects disabled.

### 768 / 1024
- Header/nav: desktop layout unaffected, focus rings visible.
- Logo: appropriate size; no overflow.
- Scroll: none; decorative elements behind content.
- Tap targets: meet sizes; actions readable.
- Content: images render in frames as intended.
- Overlaps/skew: subtle overlaps enabled on ≥768 only.

## C. Specific Findings (files touched)
- _includes/nav.html: add mobile hamburger toggle; cap mobile logo width; avoid crowding.
- assets/build/css/overrides.css: unhide post images; pointer-events none for hero stripe; soften mobile angles; prevent horizontal scroll; increase action button padding; add nav variable fallbacks; mobile nav z-index and focus styles.
- AUDIT_REPORT.md: document audit and checks.

## D. Regression Guardrails
- Avoid adding new `h-[var(--…)]`/`gap-[var(--…)]` utilities without ensuring build picks them up or fallbacks exist.
- Keep decorative pseudo-elements `pointer-events: none` and below interactive layers.
- Maintain tap target minimums (44px) for any new controls.
- Limit aggressive skew/negative margins on mobile; enable overlaps only ≥768px.

## E. Diff Summary (why minimal)
- Used a native `<details>/<summary>` toggle to avoid JS and keep changes reversible.
- Scoped CSS adjustments: a few selectors and media queries instead of refactors.
- Restored images with generic, safe rules; no template rewrites needed.
- Added root variable fallbacks to guard against missing tokens without touching build config.
