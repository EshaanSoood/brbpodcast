Podcast Page Tidy — Plan (no code changes yet)

Scope: _layouts/entry.html, assets/build/css/overrides.css (optional read of _layouts/default.html for container check). No JS, no color/type changes.

1) Kill stray rule under H1
- Inspect computed styles of h1.podcast-title for border/box-shadow/pseudo (::after) causing a line.
- If inherited from a generic .post-title/.page-title rule, neutralize only for .podcast-title (border: 0; box-shadow: none; background: none).
- Ensure no adjacent hr is inserted by the template near the title (verify entry.html around the podcast branch).

2) Title/date spacing cohesion
- Treat title+date as one cluster. Set:
  - .podcast-title { margin-bottom: 0.25rem; }
  - .podcast-date  { margin-top: 0; display: block; opacity: 0.85; }
- Verify keyboard order: title → date → video.

3) Video block top spacing
- Reduce top margin of .podcast-video to match header rhythm:
  - .podcast-video { margin-block: clamp(0.5rem, 1.8vw, 1rem); }
- Keep aspect-ratio: 16/9 and container width unchanged.

4) About card readability width
- Constrain about card width while keeping container edges aligned:
  - .podcast-wrap .podcast-about { max-width: 70ch; margin-inline: 0; }
- Maintain existing padding/border; do not change colors/typography.

5) Website link in chip row (no stranded link)
- Ensure Website appears inside the single .podcast-links row:
  - In entry.html, confirm the Website anchor is inside .podcast-links (it is). Keep order: Website first, then social chips.
  - In CSS, enforce a single row flow with wrap:
    - .podcast-links { display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 0.5rem 0.75rem; align-items: center; }
  - Ensure .social-btn styling applies to Website as well (same class).

6) Container sanity and rhythm
- Header, video, about card, and links remain inside the existing .site-container from default layout. Do not nest a second .site-container around the podcast branch.
- Rhythm targets:
  - title→date = small
  - date→video = small/medium
  - video→about = medium
  - about→links = small/medium

7) Minimal diffs (when applying)
- CSS: add narrowly-scoped rules for .podcast-title/.podcast-date/.podcast-video/.podcast-about/.podcast-links in overrides.css.
- HTML: only adjust placement/order if the Website link is found outside .podcast-links (currently OK); otherwise no HTML changes needed.

Acceptance (self-check before returning diffs)
- No visible rule/line under the H1.
- Title/date read as a single unit with tight spacing.
- Video top spacing balanced with sections below.
- About card width ~70ch, improved readability.
- Website link is within the chip row, aligned with other chips.
- Edges align to the nav’s .site-container; no extra wrappers added.
